# e2e

This repository contains branches with sample code for our e2e tests. This example uses the [app-root-path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/app-root-path) module to retrieve the application root which is not working with Paketo due to its linked node_modules. The related issue there is [Path resolution in npm linked modules report module and not root app path. #33](https://github.com/inxilpro/node-app-root-path/issues/33).
